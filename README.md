# Uncertainty Qauntification in CFD simulations

This repository contains codes developed during my PhD at University of Groningen. Python scripts for the 3D U-Net Artificial Neural Network (ANN) - data processing, model training and validation, prediction and some handy utilities. 

## Surrogate Based Uncertainty Quantification using 3D U-Net Model

A 3D U-Net ANN was trained using the data from single wind turbine simulations, and coupled with Wake-Superposition Model to make flow-field predictions over an array of wind turbines as shown below. More details can be found in -
